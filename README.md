<h1>Pegman Walking</h1>
<p>This is a spin off from the motorcycle demo. I wanted to make a demo that features a moving object not just on a map but also on the Street View. For the moving object I chose a human as I wanted to construct a function that produces movement combined with a pattern of steps. I also wanted the streetview to be impersonated by a camera that follows the moving object. I made two such cameras. One that follows the character from behind and another that tries to find itself on the character's path so it can film him from the front. The two cameras turn around automatically whe the character passes by and change locations when the character gets too far.</p>
